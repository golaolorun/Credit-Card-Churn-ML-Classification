# Credit-Card-Churn-ML-Classification
Data Science project using Classification Model
- by: _Gbenga Olaolorun_

## Description
This project aims to build a machine learning classification model to predict whether customers of Thera Bank are likely to stop using their credit card services. The model will help the bank identify potential churn risks, understand which customer attributes contribute to churn, and enable the bank to focus on customer retention efforts by improving key areas of service.

## Background and Context
Thera Bank has recently experienced a significant decline in the number of credit card users. Since credit cards are a major source of revenue—generating fees such as annual fees, late payment fees, and foreign transaction fees—this decline poses a risk to the bank’s income. The bank wants to better understand the factors leading to customer churn so it can take proactive steps to prevent further loss.
The goal is to analyze customer data to predict churn and determine the reasons for it, allowing the bank to make strategic adjustments that could reduce attrition and retain more customers.The goal is to analyze customer data to predict churn and determine the reasons for it, allowing the bank to make strategic adjustments that could reduce attrition and retain more customers.

## Data
The dataset includes various attributes of credit card customers, such as demographic information, banking behavior, and transaction patterns. The objective is to use this data to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will discontinue using their credit card.

## Data Dictionary
-  CLIENTNUM: Unique identifier for the customer holding the account
-  Attrition_Flag: Indicates whether the account is closed ("Attrited Customer") or still active ("Existing Customer")
-  Customer_Age: Age of the customer (in years)
-  Gender: Gender of the account holder
-  Dependent_count: Number of dependents
-  Education_Level: Educational qualification of the customer (e.g., Graduate, High School, Post-Graduate, Doctorate)
-  Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer
-  Income_Category: Annual income category of the customer
-  Card_Category: Type of credit card held by the customer
-  Months_on_book: Length of time the customer has been with the bank
-  Total_Relationship_Count: Total number of products held by the customer
-  Months_Inactive_12_mon: Number of months the customer has been inactive in the last 12 months
-  Contacts_Count_12_mon: Number of contacts between the customer and the bank in the last 12 months
-  Credit_Limit: Credit limit on the customer’s credit card
-  Total_Revolving_Bal: Balance carried over from one month to the next
-  Avg_Open_To_Buy: Average remaining credit available for spending (over the last 12 months)
-  Total_Trans_Amt: Total transaction amount over the last 12 months
-  Total_Trans_Ct: Total number of transactions in the last 12 months
-  Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1: Change in the total number of transactions from the 4th quarter to the 1st quarter
-  Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1: Change in the total transaction amount from the 4th quarter to the 1st quarter
-  Avg_Utilization_Ratio: Average credit card utilization ratio over the last 12 months

## Objective
-  Predict whether a customer will stop using their credit card services (churn).
-  Identify which customer attributes are most significant in predicting churn.
-  Optimize the model using appropriate techniques to achieve the best performance.
-  Generate insights and recommendations for Thera Bank to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## Results
- The project will evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into which features drive churn the most.
